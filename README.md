The Power BI dashboard titled "Coffee Shop Analysis" provides an extensive overview of metrics related to store locations, product types, and transaction data for a coffee shop. At the top of the dashboard, there are button filters for Astoria, Hell's Kitchen, and Lower Manhattan. These buttons enable users to filter the displayed data based on the selected store location, allowing for a focused analysis of each store.

The bar chart on the left, which displays the total transactions by product type, reveals that Houseware, Chai Tea, and Organic Beans have the highest number of transactions, with 526, 515, and 411 respectively. This indicates these product types are particularly popular among customers. Adjacent to this chart is a line chart depicting the sum of unit prices plotted against the total cost. The line chart shows a significant spike at the beginning, followed by a gradual decline, suggesting a few high-priced transactions skewing the initial data and a subsequent shift towards lower-cost items over time.

A vertical bar chart in the middle section of the dashboard illustrates the sum of transaction quantities by month. The data reveals that June and May have the highest transaction quantities, with 51K and 48K respectively, indicating these months are particularly busy, potentially due to seasonal factors or promotions. In contrast, there is a noticeable drop in transactions during March, January, and February.

The map visualization provides a geographical perspective, showing the locations of the stores across North America. This helps in understanding the market coverage and potential areas for expansion. Below the map, a stacked bar chart illustrates the sum of total cost and transaction quantity by product category and type. It highlights that Coffee has the highest total cost at 0.27M, indicating it is a significant revenue generator for the coffee shop. This is followed by Tea and Bakery items, which also contribute substantially to the total costs and transaction quantities.

Lastly, a donut chart represents the sum of unit prices by product category, product type, and product. The chart highlights distinct segments for Packaged Chocolate and Flavours, though these categories appear less dominant compared to others like Coffee and Tea in the overall cost and transaction distribution.

In summary, this dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of product performance, monthly transaction trends, and geographical distribution. The insights suggest that Houseware, Chai Tea, and Organic Beans are top-performing product types, with Coffee being a major revenue contributor. The transaction trends show peak activity in May and June, while geographical insights highlight a concentrated market presence in North America. These analyses can aid in strategic decision-making for inventory management, marketing, and sales optimization.
